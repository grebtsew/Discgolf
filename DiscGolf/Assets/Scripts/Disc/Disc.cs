     * Speed is the rate at which a disc can travel through the air.
     * Speed 14 Distance Drivers are the fastest, having the PDGA maximum legal wing width.
     * Faster discs cut into the wind with less effort and are best when throwing up wind.
     * Slower discs take more power to throw upwind, but they’re easier to throw more accurately
     * and may actually go farther downwind. High speed discs are not recommended for beginners
     * as they require more power to fly properly.

     * Beginners wanting more distance should choose discs with more glide.
     * Discs with less glide are more accurate in high wind situations.

     * High Speed Turn is the tendency of a disc to turn over or bank to the right (for RHBH throws)
     * during the initial part of the flight. A disc with a +1 rating is most resistant to turning over,
     * while a -5 rating will turn the most. Discs rated -3 to -5 make good roller discs.
     * Discs with less turn are more accurate in the wind. Discs with more turn are easier to throw for beginners.

     * Low Speed Fade is the discs tendency to hook left (for RHBH throws)
     * at the end of the flight. Fade is rated from 0 to 5. A disc rated 0 will finish straightest,
     * while a disc rated 5 will hook hard at the end of the flight. 
     * High fade discs are usually used for Spike and Skip shots.

# Discgolf game

This game is a simplistic discgolf simulator created in Unity C#. The motivation for this project is that I really enjoy the sport and wanted to try building a simulation of it. I quickly noticed during development that it is quite addictive to make the disc hit the chains. 
Disc data is collected from Discport.se.
The physics might appear goofy, as I added gamification solution for handling disc stats. 
This should probably be updated in the future for a more realistic simulation.
See the implementations in `Calculations` folder for a better physics implementation in python3.


The user design is heavily influenced by the MS2020 game design and Quantum UI - GUI Tools.


Tested on Windows 11, Unity3d 2020.3.26f1.

# Discgolf game

This game is a simplistic discgolf simulator created in Unity C#. The motivation for this project is that I really enjoy the sport and wanted to try building a simulation of it. I quickly noticed during development that it is quite addictive, changing small values to make the disc hit the chains. 
Disc data is collected from Discport.se.
The physics might appear goofy, as I added gamification solution for handling discstats. 
This should probably be updated in the future for a more realistic simulation.
See the implementations in `Calculations` folder for a better physics implementation in python3.


The user design is heavily influensed by the MS2020 game design and Quantum UI - GUI Tools.


Tested on Windows 11, Unity3d 2020.3.26f1.
